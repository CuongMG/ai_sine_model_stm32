This project deploys a sine value prediction model on stm32 through the stm32cube AI library with version 8.1.0.
We build a sine prediction model on Google colab. After training the model, we convert it to tflite or keras format, download the model to the computer and analyze and convert to .h format through the stmcube AI library to deploy on stm32
